				<p>Not many books are as self aware as Delighting in the Trinity. Reeves admits that reading a book on the Trinity probably doesn’t sound very exciting. And yet it is. The book is a simple discussion regarding the Trinity that could actually be read by someone outside the faith. You might think that strange, but Reaves ministers in Wales at my alma mater, it’s how I wish all theology books were written.</p>

				<p>In addition to the training pathway, we will be launching The Church Plantology Podcast, which platforms voices of church planting leaders from all over the globe, highlighting the Church Plantology principles that can be harnessed at any time, anywhere, among anyone, to advance the kingdom of God. The podcast has been in development for nearly a year as our team conducted interviews in partnership with Bible League International, and I’m excited that it will debut next month.

We will also be launching new initiatives like interactive cohorts and our first YouTube series.

It’s going to be a busy year!

We hope you’ll join us in partnership and presence as we make this next leg of the journey</p>

				<p>While 2022 was a great year for sowing and watering in NewBreed, we’re even more excited about the reaping God has in store for 2023.

We will continue to sow and water by developing resources and training church planting leaders.

But we are most excited for THEM to start the reaping of newly formed believers who come through their tireless gospel work.

After all, today’s disciples will be tomorrow’s planters.

And when that happens, they become those that sow, water, and reap. This is why Jesus called us to make disciples. The process is exponential when we focus on training and discipleship.

Our most powerful tool to help them sow, water, and reap for the greatest harvest is our Plantology Pathway; a three-phase curriculum that trains them to master what Paul learned over his three missionary journeys.

The Plantology Pathway can be completed at their own speed (2-5 years) that takes them through the basics of planting like Paul in his first missionary journey to developing a catalytic training hub in Ephesus on his third missionary journey.

It’s a BIG undertaking, and for the first time since I completed the Plantology textbook (in 8 months!), I’ll be setting myself aside with some additional team members to run at this project. If you know me, you know that I’ve always chosen to work another job so that I don’t bottleneck NewBreed’s progress.

But we need your help to do it.

Now, you may not be aware, but NewBreed relies on everyday gospel partners like you to fulfill our mission. And more resources means we need more help to meet these goals. Would you consider partnering with us in 2023?

Your donation will help us equip indigenous missionaries all over the world. As an added benefit, since NewBreed is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, your donation is tax deductible.

Oh yeah…
