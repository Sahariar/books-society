			"In Living in the Light, Shakti Gawain introduced a powerful new way of life: that of listening to one's own intuition and relying on it as a guiding force. In the newly revised edition of that classic work, she elaborates on her original ideas, adding aspects of her own experiences and learning process over the past twelve years. In addition to balancing feminine and masculine energies, she now examines several other fundamental polarities we all have, such as power and vulnerability. Everyone's life journey involves developing the full range of self and acknowledging all aspects of one's personality -- including both light facets and dark.",

			"For generations, we have focused on the individual drivers of success: passion, hard work, talent, and luck. But in today dramatically reconfigured world, success is increasingly dependent on how we interact with others. In Give and Take, Adam Grant, an award-winning researcher and Whartonâ€™s highest-rated professor, examines the surprising forces that shape why some people rise to the top of the success ladder while others sink to the bottom. Praised by social scientists, business theorists, and corporate leaders, Give and Take opens up an approach to work, interactions, and productivity that is nothing short of revolutionary.",

			"From acclaimed psychologist Dr. Shad Helmstetter comes a life-changing guide to helping you help yourself through motivational self-talk and positive thinking. Imagine relying on yourself to optimize your outlook, focus your plans, and keep you on top, in touch, and going for it! You can do it, by adopting the simple techniques of self-talk, and understanding the power of key phrases like these: I choose my thoughts. No thought, at any time, can dwell in my mind without my permission. I have talents, skills and abilities--and I'm discovering new talents all the time. I take time to listen and communicate. I'm patient and understanding. It's worth working at, and I do. I focus my attention on the things I can control. If l can't affect it or direct it--I accept it. I know that what I believe about myself is what l will become--so I believe in the best for myself. Acclaimed psychologist Dr. Shad Helmstetter shows you how to make positive self-talk a permanent habit. Give yourself the kind, loving, determined support you would give to your best friend.
